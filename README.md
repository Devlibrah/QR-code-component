### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned how to align a div in the center using the transform and position properties.

```css
.container{
position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```


### Continued development

I would focus on and improve on my use of media queries.



### Useful resources

- (https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - This helped me with the div alignment. I would continue using this pattern in the future. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
